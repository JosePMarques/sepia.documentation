Exercise 3
==========

Objectives
----------

- Understanding why we need to remove the background magnetic field contributions before QSM  
- Fine-tuning method parameters to improve the background field removal results

Data Required
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- a 3D total field image (*Sepia_total-field.nii.gz* in the previous exercise output directory)
- a 3D brain mask (*Sepia_mask.nii.gz* in the previous exercise output directory)
- a SEPIA header (*Sepia_header.mat* in the input directory)

Estimated time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

About 10 min.

Background Field Removal  
------------------------

The frequency map we obtained from the last exercise contains magnetic fields generated by not only the brain tissue but also the scanner hardware imperfection and fields generated at air/tissue interfaces. Therefore we have to remove the non-tissue field, or background field, contributions before computing the susceptibility map.

   Figure 1: The total field we obtained from the last exercise is the summation of tissue and background magnetic fields. In order to compute the magnetic susceptibility of the brain tissue correctly, the background field contributions have to be removed before mapping the tissue susceptibilities.

SEPIA provides 7 methods to remove the background magnetic fields. Today we will use the Laplacian boundary values (LBV) algorithm, which is, in general, quite robust. 

Go to the **Background field removal** tab. You will see two panels as the **Phase unwrapping** tab. 

In the **I/O** panel, specify by using the open buttons:

- **Total field**: *Sepia_total-field.nii.gz* from the output directory of the previous exercise;
- **Header**: *Sepia_header.mat* from the input directory 
- **Brain mask** *Sepia_mask.nii.gz* from the output directory of the previous exercise, which will tell the software what is not part of the background.  

Second, in the **Background field removal** panel, the 'LBV' method is shown by default. You can have three parameters to adjust. 

- 'Tolerance': a threshold to stop the algorithm. 
- 'Depth': multigrid level. 
- 'Peel': the layer of boundary voxels to be removed after computing the tissue (or so-called local) fields. 

In this exercise, we will focus on the differences when using different 'Peel' values. 

1. Change the **Output basename** to: *~/qsm_tutorial/data/output_backgroundremove/Sepia_peel-2*

2. Press the **Start** button. Again, you will see the message '*Processing pipeline is completed!*' when the process is finished. 

3. After the first processing is done, change the 'Peel' value to '4'

4. Change the **Output Basename** to *~/qsm_tutorial/data/output_backgroundremove/Sepia_peel-4* and then press the **Start**

5. Use FSLeyes to display both output images (should be in *~/qsm_tutorial/data/output_backgroundremove/*) at the same time:

  ``fsleyes Sepia_peel-2_local-field.nii.gz``

  You can do this using the '+' button in the bottom right panel and select *Sepia_peel-4_local-field.nii.gz* in the window provided.

  Adjust the display window to 'Min. -5' and 'Max. 5'. Use the 'Opacity' slide to alter the transparency of the top image. What is the main difference between the two results?

Note that you can also see very clearly the contrast between grey and white matter, and veins and tissue now. Other structures as the globus pallidus, red nuclei and substantia nigra are visible... but not quite normal.

7. Compare the location of the edges with what you can see in the mean magnitude image. This can be computed on the terminal using (assuming you are still in the data directory, if not then go back to the data directory *~/qsm_tutorial/data/*):

  ``fslmaths mag.nii.gz -Tmean mag_mean.nii.gz``
