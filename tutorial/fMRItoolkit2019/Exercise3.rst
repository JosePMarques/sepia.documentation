Exercise 3
==========

Objectives
----------

- Understanding why we need to remove the background magnetic field contributions before QSM  
- Fine-tuning method parameters to improve the background field removal results

Data Required
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- a 3D total field image (*Sepia_total-field.nii.gz* in the previous exercise output directory)
- a 3D brain mask (*Sepia_mask.nii.gz* in the previous exercise output directory)
- a SEPIA header (*Sepia_header.mat* in the input directory)

Estimated time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

About 10 min.

Background Field Removal  
------------------------

The frequency map we obtained from the last exercise contains magnetic fields generated by not only the brain tissue but also the scanner hardware imperfection and fields generated at air/tissue interfaces. Therefore we have to remove the non-tissue field, or background field, contributions before computing the susceptibility map.

   Figure 1: The total field we obtained from the last exercise is the summation of tissue and background magnetic fields. In order to compute the magnetic susceptibility of the brain tissue correctly, the background field contributions have to be removed before mapping the tissue susceptibilities.

SEPIA provides 7 methods to remove the background magnetic fields. Today we will use the Laplacian boundary values (LBV) algorithm, which is, in general, quite robust. 

Go to the **Background field removal** tab. You will see two panels as the **Phase unwrapping** tab. 

In the **I/O** panel, specify by using the open buttons:

- **Total field**: *Sepia_total-field.nii.gz* from the output directory of the previous exercise;
- **Header**: *Sepia_header.mat* from the input directory 
- **Brain mask** *Sepia_mask.nii.gz* from the output directory of the previous exercise, which will tell the software what is not part of the background.  

Second, in the **Background field removal** panel, the 'LBV' method is shown by default. You can have three parameters to adjust. 

- 'Tolerance': a threshold to stop the algorithm. 
- 'Depth': multigrid level. 
- 'Peel': the layer of boundary voxels to be removed after computing the tissue (or so-called local) fields. 

In this exercise, we will focus on the differences when using different 'Peel' values. 

1. Change the **Output basename** to: *~/qsm_tutorial/data/output_backgroundremove/Sepia_peel-2*

2. Press the **Start** button. Again, when the process is finished, you will see the message:
   '*Processing pipeline is completed!*'. 

3. After the first processing is done, change the 'Peel' value to '4'

4. Change the **Output Basename** to *~/qsm_tutorial/data/output_backgroundremove/Sepia_peel-4* and then press the **Start**

5. Use FSLView to display the local field map (Hz) when using 'Peel' value of 2 (should be in *~/qsm_tutorial/data/output_backgroundremove/*):

  ``fslview_deprecated Sepia_peel-2_local-field.nii.gz &``

  Load the *Sepia_peel-4_local-field.nii.gz* map in the same window. You can do this by selecting 'File :raw-html:`&rarr;` Add...' (or shorcut `Crtl+A`) and select *Sepia_peel-4_local-field.nii.gz* in the window provided.

  i. Adjust the display window to 'Min -5' and 'Max 5' for both images. 
  
  ii. Go to location [119 142 88] so that you can see the differences between the two maps with a better view. 
  
  iii. Check/Uncheck the 'Visibility' button in the buttom of the viewer to turn on/off of the top image. What is the main difference between the two results?

Note that you can also see very clearly the contrast between grey and white matter, and veins and tissue now. Other structures as the globus pallidus, red nuclei and substantia nigra are visible... but not quite normal.

6. Compare the location of the edges with what you can see in the mean magnitude image. (Assuming you are still in the data directory, if not then go back to the data directory *~/qsm_tutorial/data/* in the terminal) This can be computed on the terminal using:

  ``fslmaths mag.nii.gz -Tmean mag_mean.nii.gz``

  i. Use shortcut `Crtl+A` in the viewer to add *mag_mean.nii.gz* to the currently displayed loca field maps.

  ii. Adjust the display window of *mag_mean.nii.gz* to 'Min 0' and 'Max 300'.

  iii. Go to location [133 155 81] which is the top edge of the globus pallidus.

  iv. Check/Uncheck the 'Visibility' button to turn on/off of the mean magnitude image.

  v. It is known that there is high concentration of iron deposition (i.e. paramagnetic substance) in the globus pallidus. Can you identify the secondary magnetic field generated by this structure?
