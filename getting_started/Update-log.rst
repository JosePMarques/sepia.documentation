0.7.3 (20191109)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Support [nonlinear dipole inversion (NDI)](https://github.com/polakd/NDI_Toolbox) as external library

0.7.2 (20190604)  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Support single-echo dataset
* Bug fix with odd-number matrix dimension by zero-padding
* Offload unuse variables to reduce memory usage
* Bug fix for reading NIfTI when the rescale slope and intercept are not 1 and 0

0.7.1 (20190509)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Support simple susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) and susceptibility map weighted imaging (SMWI) as part of the GUI
* resolved loading/saving NIfTI issue related to 0.7.0 update
